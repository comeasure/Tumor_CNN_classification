# CNN Project

This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image 
classification.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/comeasure/Tumor_CNN_classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Tumor_CNN_classification
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have your dataset in the appropriate directory (not included 
in the repository due to confidentiality).
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `model.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.

## Note

This repository does not include the dataset. You need to have access to 
the dataset and place it in the correct directory as expected by the 
`model.ipynb` file.
